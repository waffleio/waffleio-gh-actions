# GitHub Actions from Waffle.io 🏃🏃🏃 

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are a great way to automate and customize your team's workflow in GitHub 🏃.  

[Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/features/) is developer-first project management for GitHub, helping teams stay aligned and automate their workflow.  While [WaffleBot 🤖 already automates 100,000+ actions per month](https://waffle.io/features/automation) to keep your Waffle boards update for you, our users are always asking to automate more and more things.  While we'd love to automate #AllTheThings, some uses cases are specific to you and your team.  [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) are great for these use cases!

This repo includes [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) contributed by Waffle.io and examples of how to create your own [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for your own use cases 🛠.

Fork 🍴 this repo to use as a starting point to create your own GitHub Actions.  What will you automate in your workflow 🤖?

## Create Your Own GitHub Action

We recommend starting by checking out our [New Issue Comment action](/action-newissuecomment).  It's a good example of a basic GitHub Action that updates an GitHub issue via the GitHub API.

## GitHub Actions from Waffle.io

* [New Issue Comment action](/action-newissuecomment) - an action that thanks contributors for creating a new issue and provide a link to your repo's CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines.
* [Issue Checklist Checker action](/action-checklistchecker) - an action that labels issues with incomplete checklists and enforces complete checklists to close issue.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for how Waffle.io's GitHub Actions could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue!  Or pull request! We'd love all and any contributions.

For more, check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This project uses [Waffle.io](https://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io) to keep track of issue and pull request status.

### Debugging
If you've followed the steps above and it isn't working, trying the following:
* If you don't see an Actions tab in your repo, make sure your repo is private and make sure you've been accepted into the private beta.
* If you see the Actions tab but there isn't a comment on your new issue, click on the Log link on the action to view the log and check for errors.
