# 🏷 🏷 🏷 Bulk Labels - GitHub Action

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to bulk add labels when creating a new issue 📝.

## How It Works

This GitHub Action runs when an [`issues` event webhook](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#issuesevent) is fired in your GitHub repo. The action checks if there are incomplete checklist items `- [ ] to do` in markdown in the issue's description. If there is 1 or > incomplete checklist items, the action labels the issue with "Incomplete Items". Also, if the issue is closed with incomplete checklist items, the action will reopen the issue and comment on the issue.

## Installation

To use this GitHub Action, you must have access to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). GitHub Actions are currently only available in private beta (you must [apply for access](https://github.com/features/actions)) and only work in private repos.

To setup this action:

1. Create a `.github/main.workflow` in your GitHub repo.
2. Add the following code to the `main.workflow` file and commit it to the repo's `master` branch.

```
workflow "Issue Checklist Checker" {
  resolves = ["CheckChecklist"]
  on = "issues"
}

action "CheckChecklist" {
  uses = "waffleio/gh-actions/action-checklistchecker@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

3. Whenever you create, update, close, or reopen an issue, the action will run!
